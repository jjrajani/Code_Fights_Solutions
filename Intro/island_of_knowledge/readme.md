### Are Equally Strong
#### Task:
Call two arms equally strong if the heaviest weights they each are able to lift are equal.

Call two people equally strong if their strongest arms are equally strong (the strongest arm can be both the right and the left), and so are their weakest arms.

Given your and your friend's arms' lifting capabilities find out if you two are equally strong.

#### Example

```
For yourLeft = 10, yourRight = 15, friendsLeft = 15 and friendsRight = 10, the output should be

areEquallyStrong(yourLeft, yourRight, friendsLeft, friendsRight) = true;

For yourLeft = 15, yourRight = 10, friendsLeft = 15 and friendsRight = 10, the output should be

areEquallyStrong(yourLeft, yourRight, friendsLeft, friendsRight) = true;

For yourLeft = 15, yourRight = 10, friendsLeft = 15 and friendsRight = 9, the output should be

areEquallyStrong(yourLeft, yourRight, friendsLeft, friendsRight) = false.

#### Task:
Given an array of integers, find the maximal absolute difference between any two of its adjacent elements.

#### Example

```
For inputArray = [2, 4, 1, 0], the output should be

arrayMaximalAdjacentDifference(inputArray) = 3.
```

### Is IPv4 Address
#### Task:
An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device (e.g., computer, printer) participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. There are two versions of the Internet protocol, and thus two versions of addresses. One of them is the IPv4 address.

IPv4 addresses are represented in dot-decimal notation, which consists of four decimal numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots, e.g., 172.16.254.1.

Given a string, find out if it satisfies the IPv4 address naming rules.

#### Example

```
For inputString = "172.16.254.1", the output should be

isIPv4Address(inputString) = true;

For inputString = "172.316.254.1", the output should be

isIPv4Address(inputString) = false.

316 is not in range [0, 255].

For inputString = ".254.255.0", the output should be

isIPv4Address(inputString) = false.

There is no first number.
```

### Avoid Obstacles
#### Task:
You are given an array of integers representing coordinates of obstacles situated on a straight line.

Assume that you are jumping from the point with coordinate 0 to the right. You are allowed only to make jumps of the same length represented by some integer.

Find the minimal length of the jump enough to avoid all the obstacles.

#### Example

For inputArray = [5, 3, 6, 7, 9], the output should be
avoidObstacles(inputArray) = 4.

### Box Blur
#### Task:
Last night you had to study, but decided to party instead. Now there is a black and white photo of you that is about to go viral. You cannot let this ruin your reputation, so you want to apply box blur algorithm to the photo to hide its content.

The algorithm works as follows: each pixel x in the resulting image has a value equal to the average value of the input image pixels' values from the 3 Ã— 3 square with the center at x. All pixels at the edges are cropped.

As pixel's value is an integer, all fractions should be rounded down.

#### Example

```
For

image = [[1, 1, 1],
         [1, 7, 1],
         [1, 1, 1]]

the output should be boxBlur(image) = [[1]].

In the given example all boundary pixels were cropped, and the value of the pixel in the middle was obtained as (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 9 = 15 / 9 = ~rounded down~ = 1.

### Minesweeper
#### Task:
In the popular Minesweeper game you have a board with some mines and those cells that don't contain a mine have a number in it that indicates the total number of mines in the neighboring cells. Starting off with some arrangement of mines we want to create a Minesweeper game setup.

#### Example

```
For

matrix = [[true, false, false],
          [false, true, false],
          [false, false, false]]
the output should be

minesweeper(matrix) = [[1, 2, 1],
                       [2, 1, 1],
                       [1, 1, 1]]
