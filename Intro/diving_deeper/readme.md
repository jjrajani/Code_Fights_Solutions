### Array max Consecutive Sum
#### Task:
Given array of integers, find the maximal possible sum of some of its k consecutive elements.

####Example

```
For inputArray = [2, 3, 5, 1, 6] and k = 2, the output should be

arrayMaxConsecutiveSum(inputArray, k) = 8.

All possible sums of 2 consecutive elements are:

2 + 3 = 5;
3 + 5 = 8;
5 + 1 = 6;
1 + 6 = 7.
Thus, the answer is 8.

### Different Symbols Naive
#### Task:
Given a string, find the number of different characters in it.

#### Example

```
For s = "cabca", the output should be

differentSymbolsNaive(s) = 3.

There are 3 different characters a, b and c.
```

### Extract Each Kth
#### Task:
Given array of integers, remove each kth element from it.

#### Example

```
For inputArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and k = 3, the output should be

extractEachKth(inputArray, k) = [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10].
```

### First Digit
#### Task:
Find the leftmost digit that occurs in a given string.

#### Example

```
For inputString = "var_1__Int", the output should be

firstDigit(inputString) = '1';

For inputString = "q2q-q", the output should be

firstDigit(inputString) = '2';

For inputString = "0ss", the output should be
firstDigit(inputString) = '0'.
```
