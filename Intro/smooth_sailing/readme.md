### All Longest Strings
#### Task:
Given an array of strings, return another array containing all of its longest strings.

#### Example

For inputArray = ["aba", "aa", "ad", "vcd", "aba"], the output should be

allLongestStrings(inputArray) = ["aba", "vcd", "aba"].
```

### Common Character Count
#### Task:
Given two strings, find the number of common characters between them.

#### Example

### Is Lucky
#### Task:
Ticket numbers usually consist of an even number of digits. A ticket number is considered lucky if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half.

Given a ticket number n, determine if it's lucky or not.

#### Example

```
For n = 1230, the output should be

isLucky(n) = true;

For n = 239017, the output should be

isLucky(n) = false.
```

### Sort By Height
#### Task:
Some people are standing in a row in a park. There are trees between them which cannot be moved. Your task is to rearrange the people by their heights in a non-descending order without moving the trees.

#### Example

```
For a = [-1, 150, 190, 170, -1, -1, 160, 180], the output should be

sortByHeight(a) = [-1, 150, 160, 170, -1, -1, 180, 190].
```

### Reverse Parentheses
#### Task:

You have a string s that consists of English letters, punctuation marks, whitespace characters, and brackets. It is guaranteed that the parentheses in s form a regular bracket sequence.

Your task is to reverse the strings contained in each pair of matching parentheses, starting from the innermost pair. The results string should not contain any parentheses.

#### Example

```
For string s = "a(bc)de", the output should be

reverseParentheses(s) = "acbde".
```
